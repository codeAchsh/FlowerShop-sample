-About this Portfolio
Based on the sample images, I created a copy of the Prototype in Figma and proceeded with coding.
I did not code screen transitions, but rather faithfully followed the design, with the themes of familiarizing myself with HTML and understanding how it works. Therefore, the screen does not change when you click. I am getting used to the structure of HTML.

*If you like it, please send me a work order.
